**Before I begin, welcome to the series! In this series of my PhD surivival guide, I will be sharing tips to help you become a more productive and efficient researcher during your PhD journey. There have been a lot of lessons I've learned from senior graduate students, books, professors, and my own mistakes that I wished I had learned earlier. This blog is to share those lessons with those in PhD programs right now, so that they don't fall into the same traps that I did. Let's start!**

In your daily life, it is without a doubt that you hold many responsibilities. Those responsibilities can range from a task as simple as cooking yourself dinner to something as complicated as analyzing your data to share with your peers. 

When you address each of these responsibilities, there's always a system, and by system, I mean a set of guidelines, rules, and/or instructions that you follow. For example, let’s take doing your laundry. One rule you may follow is to separate your whites from your colors. In terms of a set of instructions, maybe you either stuff your clothes into the washer or if you're like me, then you gently lay them inside one by one, starting with the largest items first. Or, let’s take cooking dinner. Maybe you always cook dinner at a certain time. 5 pm. Every night you have to start at 5 pm. And maybe you prepare the vegetables first before the meats. Maybe you set up the cutlery on the table first, or maybe you just order it on your phone at 6 pm. When you go grocery shopping, perhaps you start at the dry goods section first, then you move to the produce section. When you are preparing for bed, maybe you start by watching some TV, then you take a shower and brush your teeth.

There’s a system to everything you do. 

And when there isn't a system, things break down quickly. If you don't set a time to cook your meals, then you likely end up forgetting to eat or you have to rush somewhere to buy takeout.  If you don't keep track of your bills, then you will forget to pay them, accrue late payment fees, and possibly spend more money than you think you still have in the bank. Having a system is incredibly important when addressing your responsibilities in life. 

In your academic PhD journey, the same is true. It is imperative to have a system for everything. A system for reading and tracking scientific papers. A system for setting up and organizing experiments. A system for analyzing data. 

Having a system increases efficiency.{% include elements/highlight.html text="A system is predictable and controllable." %}With a system, you'll be more aware of how long an experiment might take, what to do with a scientific paper after you read it so you don't forget it, or even when to take a break from work to prevent burnout. 

**My advice: Have a system for every task.**
