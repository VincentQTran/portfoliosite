### Preface ###

Before you read the following post, I highly recommend you refer to the following introduction posts:

### Introduction ###

As scientists, we consume many research papers and articles over the course of our scientific career. As we read more papers, we will find it increasingly difficult to keep track of what we have read. While some peopole can easily recall a paper without taking notes, most people, including me, will jot down a few points while reading. Here, I will discuss *my system* of keeping track of the papers I read. This system might not work for everyone, but my purpose is to set an example for you to develop your own system. 

After I joined a lab and started my research project, I blazed through a handful of papers to design my project and research workflow. I was studying the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and I read a handful of the key reviews and research articles in the field. I took notes sparingly, but I mainly relied on my own ability to recall the information later on. I had a document that compiled all my notes on EGFR, but when I needed a reference for a fellowship proposal, I had trouble tracking down the specific article. In response, I developed the following system to catalog what I have read, which has made it easier to identify the origin of a key finding as well as improved my memory retention.

### My System ###

1. Note-taking
2. Literature Matrix
3. Data Matrices and Cheatsheets
4. Author Guide

#### 1. Note-taking ####

When reading scientific papers, I take notes for each paper I read, but the contents of my notes vary among the papers. I might take very detailed, intensive notes, and other times, I will only jot down the purpose of the study and a few key findings.

A few seconds before I start reading, I quickly establish *the framework* for reading: (1) why I’m reading and (2) what I’m looking for. The quantity and quality of the notes depends on these two points. Am I reading to learn? Am I reading this paper for fun? Am I trying to find a reference for a proposal I am writing? You should determine the purpose for reading because if it is an important paper to come back to, then it will be burdensome to re-read the article every time it is revisited. In the same vein, if you are reading for fun, then you will enjoy your reading much more if it does not involve laborious note-taking.

***Research Articles***

My procedure for research articles is as follows:

1. I will have a note template with the following sections:
	- Background
	- Gap/Premise
	- Goal
	- Methodology
	- Results
	- Future Directions
2. Then, I read the paper and takes notes on parts of the paper most relevant to me and put it into the respective section.
3. After reading, I write a summary paragraph that includes the study's premise, the goal, and key results.

***Reviews***

My procedure for review articles is as follows:

1. I have a section for each corresponding section in the review.
2. As I read, I keep track of the important facts and optionally, the respective papers with the reference number.
3. After reading the review, I write a 2-3 sentence summary of the topics the review discusses. If I want to learn more, then I will read through the references I noted.

***Final Comments***

It is rare that I take notes on every single section because there might not be any information to fill in all the sections. Oftentimes, I only take takes notes on information relevant to me. Again, it depends on the framework, but my notes take on the following forms:

- Detailed - all or most sections are filled
- Sparse - only the purpose and results are filled
- Bare - only a summary is written

#### 2. Literature Matrix ####

When I finish reading a paper, I import them into a literature matrix to keep track of each paper and its relevance within a field. A literature matrix prevents me from wasting time way digging through my papers to find a reference. 

In my literature matrix, I have columns for the title/citation, the year it was published, a one-liner (usually the title paraphrased), a summary paragraph, and any other important subjects relevant to the respective field (e.g. if the matrix is for machine learning papers, then I have a column for algorithms).

Here is an example entry:

| Citation      | Year          | One-Liner      | Summary |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-------------:|:--------|
| Stokes, J.M., et al. (2020). Cell 180, 688-702.e13.| 2020 | Implementing Machine Learning in Antibiotic Discovery | In this study, Stokes et al. implements machine learning for Antibiotic Discovery to demonstrate machine learning's potential to increase the discovery rate of unique leads, decrease the resources to identify these compounds, and decrease the associated screening costs. They use a message passing neural network supplemented with molecular features generated by RdKit. Halicin is identified as a potentially strong candidate with efficacy against many drug-resistant bacterial strains. The authors screened additional small molecules libraries besides the library containing halicin; however, they were unable to find any compounds as potent as halicin, despite the fact that 10^8 compounds from the Zinc15 database were screened.|


#### 3. Cheatsheets and Data Matrices ####

When I am reading up on a particular topic, I will tend to make a *cheatsheet* and *data matrix*. While the literature matrix helps me catalog all my papers, a cheatsheet and data matrix encourage me to think more critically about a certain topic or problem.

A data matrix is basically a repository of information I want to remember from a study, such as the cell line used, the drugs or chemicals used for treatment, or the techniques employed. A cheatsheet is a summary of facts I read with their accompanying reference. Using an accompanying data matrix, I will begin to write about how certain studies are related in my cheatsheet. I use a cheatsheet and data matrix to simultaneously (1) learn about the relevant information and (2) draw connections among the studies I'm reading.

#### 4. Authors Guide ####

Lastly, I keep a short table of significant people in the respective field. I find it really helpful to track of which labs to expect high profile papers relevant to your work.

Here is an example table I made for EGFR research:

| Field         | Researcher |
| ----------    |:-----------|
| Drugs			    | Michael Eck <br> Darren Cross <br> Yosef Yarden <br> Mark Lemmon <br> Nathaneal Grey|
| Structure     | John Kuriyan <br> Mark Lemmon <br> Alanna Schepartz <br> Hirstova & Arseniev |
| Endocytosis   | Alexander Sorkin <br> Marion Zerial <br> Steven Wiley |
| Ubiquitination| Sara Sigismund <br> Robert Lefkowitz <br> Alexander Sorkin |


### Final Words ###

My system may  be a lot to take in if you're never kept track of your papers before, but these steps I've taken have been super helpful to me. Again, *this system might not be for everyone*, but{% include elements/highlight.html text ="I encourage you to create your own system" %}because it will save you from a lot of stress and headaches in the future. I do strongly recommend that your system involves a form of note-taking because if a paper sparked an idea, then you want to be sure to remember it later on.

**My advice: Have an organized approach to keeping track of your papers. Happy reading!**
